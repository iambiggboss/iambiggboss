## 🧠 Identity

* **Nickname / Handle:** Bigg Boss

## 🏗️ What I Actually Do (Not Buzzwords)

I operate across the **full IT spectrum**, designing, securing, deploying, and maintaining systems that must remain **reliable under pressure**.

* Design secure, scalable **system architectures**
* Build and harden **web applications & backend services**
* Engineer **networked environments** (LAN, WAN, cloud, hybrid)
* Perform **offensive & defensive security analysis**
* Automate infrastructure, deployments, and monitoring
* Deliver end‑to‑end **IT solutions for businesses**

---

## 🔐 Security‑First Engineering Philosophy

Security is not a feature. It is a **baseline condition**.

I design systems assuming:

* credentials will leak
* networks will be probed
* applications will be abused
* components will fail

If a system cannot tolerate those realities, it is unfinished.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Scenarios I Design For (Extreme Tier)

* Network compromise & lateral movement
* Privilege escalation & misconfiguration abuse
* Application‑layer attacks (OWASP Top 10)
* Infrastructure outages & partial failures
* Data integrity loss & unauthorized access
* Human error & operational mistakes

Systems must **degrade gracefully**, not collapse.
